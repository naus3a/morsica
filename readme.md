# Morsica
`Morsica` is a library + toolset to encode/decode morse code.

## Name/Pun
*Morsica* sounds a bit like *Morse* but, in italian, it translates to *it bites*; in turn, the verb *bites* sounds like *bytes* and since we're doing Morse code in digital form it sounded like a proper name.

Ok, I know: it's convoluted, but I had a long week and I needed a name. Leave me alone.
